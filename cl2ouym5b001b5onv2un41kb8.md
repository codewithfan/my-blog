## Why Am I in 100Devs Learning How to Code?

**It has been a HOT MINUTE since posting a blog…almost three months!**

Where I talked about [learning JavaScript.](https://stefantaitano.hashnode.dev/the-beginning-stage-of-learning-javascript)

I want to bring myself back to January, the beginning of the year. I am placing myself in the [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) cohort, [class one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3IIobN4xR0&t=1009s) with the community and Leon Noel.

The question I asked myself then and continue to ask myself every week is:

# Why am I sacrificing my time to learn how to code in 100Devs?

I thought this through time and time again and always came up with the same results:


1. Money
2. Quality of Life as a Software Engineer
3. Endless Opportunities for Growth

## The Money

> Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. -Henry David Thoreau

It is no secret you can make a decent living working as a Software Engineer. 

There's a reason folks, including myself, leap from (*insert lucrative career field with no stability + not enough pay + hate + tired of*) to become a Software Engineer.

Still not convinced? You can find this information with a quick google search:

There's money to be given to people who put in the hours to learn the art of code. Why do I believe money is my motive?

I crave the ability to travel the world with my family, afford to buy a house in the next five years, and keep up with the cost of living. 

Before having kids, my wife and I would take trips around the United States. New York, Toronto, Miami, and LA, are a few cities we explored. 

What was the result of those trips? Spending A LOT of money on food, lodging, and activities.

Tack on having two more kids = uptick in spending.

With growing a family, I want to own a home and not live as a renter my entire life. It's not worth it, in the long run, to pay for someone else's mortgage. 

I'm not even going to get started on inflation because we all know the current event.

## Quality of Life as a Software Engineer

> Movement is life. Life is a process. Improve the quality of the process and you improve the quality of life itself. - Moshe Feldenkrais

This quote hits deep because I feel everyone in the world can do something out of their comfort zone to improve their way of life. 

From the outside looking in, the lifestyle of a Software Engineer looks FABULOUS!

- Want to work remotely? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want unlimited PTO? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want to work with a company with flexible hours and high $$$? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want the ability to work with many companies? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want to make a positive impact on millions (possibly billions)? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want your job to pay for your new laptop, phone bill, and cell phone? Software Engineers can do it.
- Want to attend incredible conferences paid for by the company? Software Engineers can do it.

I can go on and on about this. These are a few perks of why I am excited to transition from the military to tech. 

Unfortunately, you **will not** have any of these benefits serving in the Armed Forces.

⚠️ **If you are a Software Engineer in the field and disagree about these perks, let me know why its not always greener on the other side**

## Endless Opportunities for Growth

In my journey in #100Devs, I realize this profession requires you to learn...like. A LOT!

Take a peek at the technologies presented in the 2021 Stack Overflow Developer Survey for [technology](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology) and [developer roles.](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#developer-profile-developer-roles)
 
If you are insane and want to learn about every language in the tech world, go for it. What is stopping you if you wish to transfer to a different role?

My point is that there are many roles, languages, and software to be learned that, thankfully, there will never be enough developers to fill the gap. 

And I can see why those in the field are recommended to take their time with the learning. It reminds me of my favorite quote from Leon:

> Go deep, not wide - Leon Noel

I believe when you are learning something you have a passion for, it becomes a fun journey worth living.

# Conclusion

If you made it this far, cheers to you, my friend, and thank you for reading! Today, I discussed the three reasons I am in 100Devs learning how to code. Comment below if this possibly inspired you to share why you are in 100Devs.
